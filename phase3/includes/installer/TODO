Critical (to be done before merge to trunk)
* Check with Mike Godwin if translated license with link to original text is OK
* Long single word field labels can run under input fields. Example on
  page=DBConnect in Dutch 'config-db-prefix' (Databasetabelvoorvoegsel:)
* (to be clarified by Chad) Reorganize the way made settings are handled.
  Something about them all being evaluated each page load, making things slow.
* Do not create the main page, but just display the message in user language on
  it if it does not yet exist using a hook.
* Better/more JS (Roan)
* ...

Other todo
* Selecting a different interface language on first page, should reload the page
  in the chosen language.
* Allow enabling instant commons if outside access is possible
* Remove span from 'config-sidebar' message
* Fix parsing of multi line messages in the i18n files. In page=Welcome
  multiline messages get a <p> for the second line cauding it to be displayed
  on two lines instead of in one paragraph. Example: 'config-gd'
* Make table of access rights profile for easier overview
* Consider not embedding the CC license picker, but a list of CC licenses
* Put GFDL licenses one level down, and possibly mark as not recommended. At
  least display CC above GFDL
* ...
