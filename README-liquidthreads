Hello, and thanks for your interest. Please read all of this; it's short and important.

You shouldn't deploy this with real users without warning them. They will find bugs.

Please hack Liquid Threads and make it more awesome. However, since the code is in rapid flux, send me patches instead of committing directly to this branch.

To try Liquid Threads, first, install MediaWiki as usual. Then, source maintenance/lqt.sql from your mysql console. Finally, add the following to the end of your LocalSettings.php:

	require_once('extensions/LqtPages.php');

How to contact me:
	davemccabe@gmail.com (email or jabber)
	davidmccabe in #mediawiki on irc.freenode.net

Thanks again! Obey all signs.
