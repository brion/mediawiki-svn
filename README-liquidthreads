Hello, thanks for your interest. Please read all of this; it's short and important.

This is a pre-alpha. This code is in rapid flux. It is undocumented, or doesn't yet make sense, or is confused. I am sketching. Therefore, don't report or try to fix obvious bugs; I simply haven't gotten to them yet. Also, don't commit to this branch. Instead, send me patches.

Liquid Threads is going to change a lot before release. Some of the coolest features haven't appeared yet. Don't let this pre-alpha disappoint you.

To try Liquid Threads, first, install MediaWiki as usual. Then, source maintenance/lqt.sql from your mysql console. Finally, add the following to the end of your LocalSettings.php:

 require_once('extensions/LqtExtension.php');

Thanks again! Obey all signs.
