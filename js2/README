MediaWiki Javascript phase 2

This folder will hold all the "new" jquery based javascript. 

Its in a separate folder for the following reasons:

* It represents a significantly different direction for the javascript organizational structure. 
* Javascript should not be tied to skins. 
* We can better manage re-factoring to jQuery based javascript by separating it out into a separate folder.
* interface skins have to be self contained because they are "embedable" in other contexts. 
	(we don't want to load the entire mediaWiki css for styling an external embed of our video player)
	   

== Stand-Alone Library Encapsulation ==
* We now include a few stand-alone libraries that alter the general flow of javascript in such a way that a separate folder will be helpful. 
* mwEmbed is a ~stand alone~ platform for embeding mediaWiki api and media functionality into web-pages.
* Script front-loading is managed by scripts in the mwjs2 folder.  


== guide lines for re-factoring your Javascript phase 2 style ==
* First step is to learn jQuery. :) (it will make your javascript life much easier)
* If your interface is something that would be useful for external usage. You Should factor it into the 
	mv_embed set of libraries that way its embeddable into external contexts.   

* If your interface is something mediaWiki specific you should extend and configure mv_embed object calls. 
* for example see the add_media_wizard.js
